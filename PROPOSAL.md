<h1>Project Title: Library Application Prototype</h1>
<h3>Project Goal</h3> The goal of the project is to develop a basic web application that serves as a book library catalog consisting of REST API backend and a simple frontend interface. 
The application will cater to two types of users:

* The Readers (public users) that will be able to browse books by their genre, author or title.
* The Librarians (authorized users) that will be able to manage the library by the addition, updating and deletion of books.
